Hello my name is Pranav
I live in India
I am 21 years old
I like cars

They had made it to Las Vegas, wide-eyed and with so much hope
and energy. They had planned the trip for more than a year and

They still hadn't realized that Las Vegas promised a place
where dreams come true, it was actually the place where dreams came to die.
